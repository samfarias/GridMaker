# Grid-Maker
This is the main repository for The Grid-Maker Website Project.

## Project-Overview
The Grid Maker  is a group-based interactive website that allows users to create and manipulate a grid of cells. By clicking menu buttons, users can add or remove rows and columns on the fly. They can also choose a color from a dropdown menu to fill or clear the cells in various ways either one cell at a time, all uncolored cells, or the entire grid. This functionality demonstrates core web development concepts taught in the class such as HTML for structure (home and grid pages, the table, menu buttons) CSS for styling (default cell appearance, home and grid maker pages design) JavaScript for DOM manipulation and event handling (adding/removing rows and columns, applying & clearing colors).

## Features

   **Add Row**  
   -  Insert a new row at the bottom of the grid. Each new cell starts out white and clickable ready for coloring.

   **Add Column**  
   - Expand the grid sideways by adding a new column to every existing row. 

   **Remove Row**  
   - Need fewer rows? Click “Remove Row” to delete the bottom row. 

   **Remove Column**  
   - Trim the grid horizontally by removing the rightmost column from each row. If no columns remain, the entire grid resets to empty.

  **Select Color**  
   - Pick from Red, Blue, Green, or Yellow in the dropdown. Once selected, this color is ready for use across all your grid cells.

   **Color Single Cell**  
   - Simply click on a cell to color it with your chosen hue. If you haven’t selected a color yet, you’ll get a reminder to do so first.

   **Fill All Uncolored**  
   - Instantly color every white (uncolored) cell without overwriting any that already have color.

   **Fill All**  
   - Transform the entire grid into one color with a single click, whether cells were previously colored or not.

   **Clear All**  
   - Reset every cell back to white. This doesn’t affect the number of rows or columns.

   **Homepage Link**  
    - Start on a welcoming homepage that introduces the project and team members, then jump to the Grid Maker page.

   **Back to Homepage**  
    - On the grid page a button takes you straight back to the homepage if you need to review the team list or start over.
